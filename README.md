# Saturn-Fix RSS/RO 1:1 scale for RSS/RO use ONLY!
My own personal fixes of some Saturn V and IB rockets on the forums where the author is gone but restricted license. Can't release it there.

* Used with FASA engines, download them here: https://github.com/KSP-RO/FASA-RO/releases


* These fixes were done by me for personal use. I am putting them here to organize my work. These are not endorsed by the author and can't be posted on the KSP forums because of license restrictions.
