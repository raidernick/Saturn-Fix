# Saturn-Fix RSS/RO 1:1 scale
My own personal fixes of some Saturn rockets on the forums where the author is gone but restricted license. Can't release it there.

* This requires the FASA engines to work and is ONLY compatible with RO/RSS full scale.


## License
* Not my mods, do whatever you want with it
* These fixes were done by me for personal use. I am putting them here to organize my work. These are not endorsed by the author and can't be posted on the KSP forums because of license restrictions.
